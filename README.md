# Python Reservoir Simulation Toolbox

# Not being developed anymore

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/roessland/PRST/badge.png?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/roessland/PRST?branch=master)

The Python Reservoir Simulation Toolbox is a Python version of the MATLAB
Reservoir Simulation Toolbox. The goal is to clone the functionality found in
MRST, and add tests.

#### utils

- [x] rlencode
- [x] rldecode

#### params

- [ ] wells_and_bc boundary conditions (now a class BoundaryCondition)


## Installation

Currently there are no Python or Conda packages for this project. Download the
whole repository and copy the "PRST/pyrst" folder into your project. Any
scientific Python3 distribution such as Anaconda will satisfy the requirements.

An experimental package is available on PyPI. It is recommended to install this
within the full Anaconda2 distribution.

    pip install prst

The dependencies are not fully defined, and may be missing. Fix this using conda or pip.

    pip install numpy_groupies

To run the tests, additional dependencies are needed:

    conda install numpy scipy six pytest pip
    conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/bokeh pytest-cov
    py.test


## Linux installation (using Miniconda/Anaconda)

The installation procedure used for automatic deployments (Travis CS) is the following:

    # Download PRST
    git clone https://github.com/roessland/PRST.git

    # Download and update Miniconda for Python 2
    wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
    chmod +x miniconda.sh
    ./miniconda.sh -b -f $HOME/miniconda2
    export PATH=$HOME/miniconda2/bin:$PATH
    conda update conda

    # Install Conda packages necessary
    conda install python=2.7 numpy scipy six pytest pip
    conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/bokeh pytest-cov

    # Install pip packages necessary (using conda's pip!)
    pip install numpy_groupies

    # Run tests to see that everything is working correctly
    cd PRST
    py.test


## Linux installation (using Pip only)

To setup the development environment, and run tests, do the following:

    git clone https://github.com/roessland/PRST.git
    cd PRST
    virtualenv --python=python3 venv3
    source venv3/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    py.test

To resume working after the initial steps have been completed:

    cd PRST
    source venv3/bin/activate
    py.test

SciPy needs to be compiled when installed using `pip`, and this can take up to
30 minutes. Use conda to avoid this.


## Windows installation

Use Anaconda2 or Miniconda2.


## Troubleshooting installation

* `py.test` executable does not exist: Remember to add the Miniconda
  environment to your $PATH, as done in the steps above.

* `py.test: error: unrecognized arguments: --cov-report=term-missing ...`: This
  means that `pytest-cov` has not been installed, or that you are running the
  wrong `py.test` executable. Run `type -a py.test` to see where `py.test` is
  located. It should be in the `miniconda2`-folder if you followed the
  instructions above, or in a virtual environment folder if using the method
  below.


## Code style

To remain similar to MRST, functions and variables should be `camelCased`. All
code should be tested.


## License

MRST is GPLv3-licensed, and since PRST is a derivative work, it is also
GPLv3-licensed.


## Publish to PyPI

These steps are only needed by the maintainer of the PyPI package.

    pip install twine wheel
    git tag 0.0.1 # Version to be released
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    twine upload dist/*
